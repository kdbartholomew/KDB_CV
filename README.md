## Publications & Awards

**AMSTATNEWS: American Statistical Association**  
*ThisIsStatistics: Police Data Challenge - Best Overall Nationally*  
- Led my team to analyze Seattle crime data, delivering insights adopted by the Seattle Police Department to enhance community safety. Competing against over 70 expert teams, we aimed to deduce likely times and locations for future crimes to help police forces redistribute their patrol effectively and efficiently. By analyzing crime data from 2016, we prioritized crimes such as assault, burglary, dispute, DUI, homicide, injury, prostitution, purse snatching, robbery, and threats, focusing on those with the highest potential for patrol intervention. This thorough approach earned us the "Best Overall" national award and resulted in my findings being published in the American Statistical Association's journal. This recognition highlights my leadership and expertise in data science and statistical analysis, driving real-world change.
